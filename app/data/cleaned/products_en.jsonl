(2) Activities that could expose the device to shower gel, shampoo, soapy water, and any other laundry or cleaning products. If the device does come into contact with any such product, rinse and soak the device in fresh water for 30 minutes. (3) Scuba dives, technical dives, and diving activities at depths greater than 40 metres. (4) Composite vegan leather, composite woven, titanium, and ceramic straps are not designed for water activities (such as swimming) or to withstand sweat, and therefore it is recommended that other straps be used in such scenarios.<br>For more information about the water resistance of Huawei wearables, please visit:https://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/content/en-us15851428/.<br>Water resistance is not permanent, and performance may deteriorate with daily wear and tear. It is recommended that you regularly take your device to an authorised Huawei service center for inspection and maintenance. |\n| Connectivity | **NFC**<br>Supported<br>**Bluetooth**<br>2.4 GHz, supports BT6.0 and BR+BLE<br>**GNSS**<br>GPS (L1 + L5 Dual-band)/GLONASS/BeiDou(B1I + B1C + B2a Tri-band)/GALILEO(E1 + E5a Dual-band)/QZSS (L1 + L5 Dual-band)/NavIC |\n| Speaker | Supported |\n| Microphone | Supported |\n| Environment | **Ambient Operating Temperature**<br>-20℃–+45℃ |\n| Charging | **Charger Voltage and Current Requirements**<br>5V-10V DC/2A MAX |\n| Battery Life | HUAWEI WATCH GT 6 Pro<br>The battery can last for up to 21 days at most, up to 12 days given typical usage, or up to 7 days with AOD enabled, and up to 40 hours in the outdoor sport mode.<br>The battery life in light usage is tested under the following conditions:default factory settings, auto-detect workouts manually disabled, 30 minutes of Bluetooth calling per week, 30 minutes of audio playback per week, heart rate monitoring always on, sleep monitoring enabled at night, 90 minutes of exercise on average per week, message notifications enabled (50 messages, 6 calls, and 3 alarms per day), and the device screen activated 200 times per day. <br>The typical battery life is tested under the following conditions: default factory settings used, 30 minutes of Bluetooth calling per week, 30 minutes of audio playback per week, heart rate monitoring always on, sleep monitoring enabled at night, additional emotions/stress records enabled, 180 minutes of exercise on average per week, message notifications enabled (50 messages, 6 calls, and 3 alarms per day), and the device screen turned on for a total of 30 minutes per day.<br>The battery life with AOD enabled is tested under the following conditions: default factory settings used, Always On Display (AOD) enabled, 30 minutes of Bluetooth calling per week, 30 minutes of audio playback per week, heart rate monitoring always on, sleep monitoring enabled at night, additional emotions/stress records enabled, 180 minutes of exercise on average per week, message notifications enabled (50 messages, 6 calls, and 3 alarms per day), and the device screen turned on for a total of 30 minutes per day.<br>The battery life in the outdoor sport mode is tested under the following conditions: default factory settings, device screen activated 60 times per hour.<br>\\*Based on results from Huawei lab tests.
